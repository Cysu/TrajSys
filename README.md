TrajSys
=======

A useful and expansive trajectory analysis system.

What is trajectory?
-------------------

Trajectories are the low-level feature of the video, describing the movements of particular tracking points.

Why need a system?
------------------

A robust and effective trajectory tracking and analysis system would benefit the modeling of the motion patterns and activity analysis in the videos.

What is the objective?
----------------------

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly trajectory analysis system for researchers and developers of video surveillance.
